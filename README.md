# CodeCademy: Data Science Foundations Project 

## NBA Trends Project 

## Goal 

The goal of this project was to showcase my python skills to analize the 2010 and 2014 NBA seasons.  
I was able to compare the difference in means between two teams, the Knicks and Nets.  From the difference in means 
I used the overlapping histographs of each team to visualize the average points per team in the year 2010 and 2014. 
By using the crosstab function I was able to comapare two categorical(game_result and game_location) values to see 
if there is a correlation between the two.  Using visualization tools such as a scatter plot provides enough evidence 
to show that the two values are correlated.
